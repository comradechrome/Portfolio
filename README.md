** AgCubio **

The game can be described succinctly as: A bunch of small "food" cubes occupy a rectangular space. 
A bunch of player cubes move through the space. Anytime a (somewhat) bigger cube significantly overlaps a smaller cube, 
the smaller cube is eaten and the size of the bigger cube goes up appropriately. Further, big cubes can "split" in half, 
projecting part of themselves "forward"; this is usually done to ensnare smaller cubes. 
Note: smaller cubes move faster than bigger cubes.
